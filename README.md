# What can be done with Polyel?
Polyel is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) PHP framework based on the Swoole networking library, which is a C++ extension written for PHP and runs as a CLI application, allowing you to build high-performance web applications using both synchronous and asynchronous programming.

A framework that brings everything together, providing features to make web development quicker and more secure. Some features include built-in support for authentication and authorization, XSS filtering, CSRF protection, database query builder support, async email sending, input validation, time manipulation, built-in templating & view service, message management and much more...

Allowing you to create highly scalable applications and with support for web sockets, concurrent connections, Task workers, connection pools, async MySQL and non-blocking I/O programming.
